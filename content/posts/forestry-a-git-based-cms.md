So as those who have been following me may know, I keep just upgrading my blog while not really writing for it. The problem with writing for this blog is that, as much as I love VSCode, it's not the most effective for blog post writing. So I have been shopping around for a CMS that'll work with my existing blog because I do _not_ want to migrate my blog _again_. And I found this:  
[forestry.io](https://forestry.io)

Forestry is a git-based CMS that uses the markdown files that already exist in my blog and it integrates with GitHub, so I can just write a post in a WordPress-like UI:

^ That's me writing this post!

Forestry is cool because it can manage a whole bunch of stuff. That bar you see in the middle-left of the screen is actually the front matter of this post! Forestry makes front matter super easy, so that's one thing I don't need to worry about anymore.
